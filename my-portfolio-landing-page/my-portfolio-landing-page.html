  <h1>Hello! I'm Ravin Fisher</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2> 

  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>My name is Ravin Fisher and I was born and raised in the PNW. I have lived here my whole life.
    I have worked in the Banking industry since I gradutated high school in 2008. 
    I first started out in the call center as an online banking specilast. I then
    moved to a branch as a Universal Banker. Currently, I am an Account Manager in our
    Institutional Trust and Custody department, and have been here since 2016.

  <h4>Why Coding?</h4>
  <p>My sister had taken this course with Epicodus in 2019. She has really enjoyed programing and She
    believed it was something that I would also enjoy. Looking in to what coding is, I really took to
    the concept of trial and error. Workshopping trying to figure out what the issue is.
    And I love that aspect of it. I love to research, figure out why something isn't working. 
    So taking this class and learning these skills, is my intro in to a whole new world
    and figuring out if this is the place for me.
  </p>

  <h4>What Makes Me Special?</h4>
  <p>I am a lover of house plants. I probably have over 80 plants around my house. I began collecting plants
    like so many others, during the global pandemic. I have a Buddy 50 vespa named Reetah. 
    I love being able to cruise around the city and not worry about parking. I am also a member
    of a Facial Hair Club. I compete in facial hair competitions around the country,
    and I have been doing that since 2015. With these competitions, I have helped raise several thousands 
    of dollars for various charities across the country. Even more, I have made several
    live long friends from all over the world. All through facial hair.
